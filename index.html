                    My name is Xue Wu, and I am currently a full-time student at Algonquin College. Please feel free to call me Lexi, as people usually cannot pronounce my name correctly.

                    I worked for a big tech company for three and a half years, which drained my soul, so one day I woke up and decided to start a new chapter of my life, that's why I decided to join the Interactive Media Design program to find a new path. I am excited to experience different aspects of technology and design.

                    Among all the subjects, I have a love for photography and videography, especially when it portrays people in their truest state. I find joy in capturing emotions and telling stories through my lens. I am also a huge film fan, some of my favourite films are Thelma & Louise; Requiem for a Dream; The Truman Show; Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri.
